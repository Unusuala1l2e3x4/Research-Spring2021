## You should probably not contribute to this repository

Appearances aside, this repository is not a community curated world map.
It is, more or less, a data dump with git history annotating sources,
plus a little format tweakery to make it more tractable or hackable.

## What pull changes are still welcome?

If you find _technical_ (format) errors like invalid JSON, fixes are welcome.

## But what about the rest?

* if you find _data_ errors,

* want to add higher-resolution data,

* make updates of world geography as names or boundaries change,

* maybe you should host and curate a better world map yourself?

Github is great for that. This repository has no such ambition, though.

For more serious use of maps and data, there are better data sets,
and your application of them could use the customization you seek.
See Mike Bostock's excellent article [Let's Make a Map][1]!

And feel free to borrow anything from this repository, if useful.
Including this file, if you share the data you generated, as here.
