Note there were problems with 2 districts: In Atakora Province Djougou Urban and Djougou Rural were not provided by the 1992 census; in Mono Province, a new district of Lokossa was listed in the 1992 census. The total pop figure is also 8000 more than the total posted on the website. Mono Province, including Lokossa, was 8000 greater than the Province total posted on the website, which means that the country. To resolove the Djougou Urban/Rural problem, I looked at the trend line in urban population growth over the past 40 years (based on GPW2), and determined roughly 60% of the Djougou's total pop would be urban.

India boundary edges matched to bordering countries, state-level files received from InfoMap were boundary matched to other Indian states.","Population growth rates were calculated between 1991 and 2001  at the state (administrative 1) level and applied to the 2001 tahsils (administrative 3).   Exception to this rule are Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Kashmir, where the base year was 1991.  Three new states were created between the 1991 and 2001 censuses (Jharkland, Chhattisgargh, and Uttar Pradesh).  These were aggregated with their parent states before a growth rate could be applied to extrapolate the tahsil level population data to target years (e.g Jharkland was recombined with Bihar and the same state level growth rate was applied to all sub units in both Jharkland and Bihar). In West Bengal, several highly populated areas were missing from the data (only on the population, not the spatial side).  These were manually added back in based on Web estimates.  For more information on these calculations, please contact us at: ciesin.info@ciesin.columbia.edu   ","ALPHA/BETA: Source info--The main data source was recently acquired InfoMap Shapefiles.  Of the 35 States (as listed on the Official censusindia.net site), we received 26 with updated 2001 data for boundaries (ADM3) and Population figures (already in place in the Shapefile, along with very detailed demographic breakouts).  The 8 States mentioned above came with updated Tahsil level ADM spatial boundary information, though the POPULATION values were taken from their 1991 Census products.  No new data (spatial OR population) were provided for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The spatial data presented here were taken from GPW2 and matched to the 1991 population data that was sent to us from Uwe Deichmann (World Bank).  Additionally, The detailed spatial information that arrived for the KACHCHH District of GUJARAT State, didn’t match up to any of the population data, so the GPW2 Spatial information was used for this region (which did match the 1991 POP figures).  The spatial information that we received for Jammu\Kashmir was less detailed than what we already have, so the spatial data for this region was taken from GPW2. No actual Population data exists for this region (specifically the Disputed Regions) so the 1990 population estimates of the disputed areas in GPW2 were aggregated to form one disputed region.  This region was then projected using Jammu and Kashmir state-level growth rates.  Another issue is that P91 represents 2 sets of 1991 data (the current set also contains spatial ADM3 data).  Lastly, the states of Bihar and Jharkhand were aggregated to Bihar (to match 1991 state-level boundaries).  Likewise, Chhatisgarh and Madha Pradesh were aggregated.  Such aggregations were necessary for the greation of 1991-2001 state-level growth rates. PROD: Kashmir units missing from 2001 state file were added in from 1991 shapefile (GPW3 beta) and population extrapolated from 1991 using state level growth rates. Units in kashmir missing population (all zero values) had 1991 population added from GPW3 beta data and extrapolated using state level growth rates.","PROD: The population fixes for India were extremely messy, largely because our new data was pieced together from various data Atul Kapoor sent to us-- this data often did not total to what the state pop values were on the Web so we had to rectify these differences.

This was done as a result of two problems: 1) a large number of boundary changes at the Tashil level and 2) the availability of 2001 population counts for a portion of the Tashils and only 1991 population counts for the rest. 1991 counts were used for Tashils within the states of Andaman & Nicobar Island, Assam, Kerala, Nagaland, Pondicherry, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.  2001 counts were used for Tashils within the states of: Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Delhi, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammy and Kashmir, Karnataka, Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya. OTHER: The main data source was recently acquired InfoMap Shapefiles. These data came with Population data already integrated, though according to the accompanying metadata from InfoMap ""demographic data for the states below have not been release by the census: Assam, Kerala, Nagaland, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, and that Boa and Mizoram are not yet complete. Of the 35 States (as listed on the Official censusindia.net site), we received 26 with updated 2001 data for boundaries (ADM3) and Population figures (already in place in the Shapefile, along with very detailed demographic breakouts).  The 8 States mentioned above came with updated Tahsil level ADM spatial boundary information, though the POPULATION values were taken from their 1991 Census products.  No new data (spatial OR population) were provided for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Thus, the spatial data presented here were taken from GPW2 and matched to the 1991 population data that was sent to us from Uwe Deichmann (World Bank).  Also, while spatial information came for the ADM boundary of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta),  no information as to its relationship to State\District\Tahsil, so it is presented here are being part of West Bengal State, its own District and Tahsil.  Population figures (it is one of the 10 most populated cities in the world) were taken from the CENSUSINDIA.NET web site, with 2001 values listed as 4,580,544. This figure added to shapefile for this district (current naming convention updated as well).  2001 District Level population figures can be found at: http://www.censusindia.net/results/dist.php?stad=A&bazz=all.  Pondicherrry (as is the case in multiple occurences in India) is a unit comprised of multiple, *non*contiguous parcels. Since on population figures were found for (State\District\Tahsil) Pondicherry, Yanam, Yanam – the POP count represented here were taken from above table as well (Pop = 31362).  Lastly, 1991 and 2001 State population counts are from http://www.censusindia.net-- these values were used to calculate state-levedl growth rates between 1991-2001 (and were later applied to the Tahsils for projecting/backcasting).",3570,"11,698,814","1,041","69,475.01","Towns (places with municipal cor_poration, municipal area committee, town commit_tee, notified area committee or cantonment board); and all places having 5,000 inhabitants or more, a density of not fewer than 1,000 persons per square mile or 390 per square kilometre, pronounced urban characteristics and at least three fourths of the adult male population employed in pursuits other than agriculture.",3200,"3,757",1,69.81,"223,398","17,332,634","1,258","89,766","287,249,961",6.96,28.1,27.9,3038,951,64,0,"India Census 1991, www.indiastat.com/default.asp; India Census 2001, Provisional Results, www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=7;World Gazetteer, www.gazetteer.de","ASCities, Census, City Population, DCW, Getty, GIS, Map, NIMA, Times Atlas of the World, 1999, UNSD, World Gazetteer",,,,,,,Ireland,IRL,Europe ,5,358,35805,Northern Europe,IE,372,4,1,69474,4,Province,County/City,Urban/Rural area,Electoral District or Ward,,3440,1996,2002,"3,427","3,589","3,810"," 3,515 "," 3,609 "," 3,803 "," 3,990 "," 4,201 "," 4,410 ",2.48,0.54,-0.19,Seamless Administrative Boundaries of Europe (SABE) distributed by Eurographics: http://www.eurogeographics.org/eng/03_projects_sabe.asps (SABE 2001 date of release : February 2003).,"Census 2002 Preliminary Report, Central Statistics Office, Dublin, Ireland: http://www.cso.ie/census/preliminary.htm .",,,,"(1) Standard interpolation.(2) Munster Province, Cork County, Mallow Rural Area, Rathluirc Election district coded to Charleville/047090 from SABE both were in Mallow Rural area and Rathluirc didn’t exist in SABE 2001 data, nor did Charleville exist in population data.
