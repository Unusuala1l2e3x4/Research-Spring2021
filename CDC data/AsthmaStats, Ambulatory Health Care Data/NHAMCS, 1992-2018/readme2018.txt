                     WARNING - DATA USE RESTRICTIONS!
                       Read Carefully before Using

    The Public Health Service Act (Section 308 (d)) provides that the data
    collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), may be used only for the
    purpose of health statistical reporting and analysis.

    Any effort to determine the identity of any reported case is prohibited
    by this law.

    NCHS does all it can to assure that the identity of data subjects cannot
    be disclosed.  All direct identifiers, as well as any characteristics 
    that might lead to identification, are omitted from the dataset.  Any
    intentional identification or disclosure of a person or establishment
    violates the assurances of confidentiality given to the providers of the
    information.  Therefore, users will:

       1.  Use the data in this dataset for statistical reporting and
           analysis only.

       2.  Make no use of the identity of any person or establishment
           discovered inadvertently and advise the Director, NCHS, of any
           such discovery.

       3.  Not link this dataset with individually identifiable data from
           other NCHS or non-NCHS datasets.

    By using these data, you signify your agreement to comply with the 
    above-stated statutorily based requirements.

   The Emergency Department (ED) component of the 2018 National Hospital  
   Ambulatory Medical Care Survey is included in this data release.

   For ease of transmission, the data file has been converted into a zipped
   (compressed) format which must be uncompressed prior to use. To uncompress,
   you can do the following:    

   1) Create a new folder on your local workstation, for example, C:\MYFILES\ED2018

   2) Download to the new folder the file ED2018.zip from the FTP server: 
      
      ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/NHAMCS/

   3) Right-click on the name of the compressed file from your directory screen. On
      the pop-up menu, there should be an option to extract the file to a location of your 
      choosing.

   In the past, the NHAMCS documentation was produced in multiple files
   which were then compressed into a single self-extracting file in ASCII 
   format.  Beginning with 1999, the documentation file has been produced 
   as a single file in PDF format which can be viewed or downloaded from the 
   above address.  This file is not compressed.

   CAUTION - Because the NHAMCS is a sample survey, the application of 
   weights to the sample data is REQUIRED to produce national estimates
   of outpatient and emergency department visits, as well as to accurately 
   assess the sampling error of statistics based on the survey data.  Please 
   refer to the documentation for instructions on how to apply the weights 
   and to obtain relative standard errors of national estimates.
