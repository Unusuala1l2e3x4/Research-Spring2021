                        Public Use File and Documentation

                         WARNING - DATA USE RESTRICTIONS!
                           Read Carefully before Using

    The Public Health Service Act (Section 308 (d)) provides that the data
    collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), may be used only for the
    purpose of health statistical reporting and analysis.

    Any effort to determine the identity of any reported case is prohibited
    by this law.

    NCHS does all it can to assure that the identity of data subjects cannot
    be disclosed.  All direct identifiers, as well as any characteristics 
    that might lead to identification, are omitted from the dataset.  Any
    intentional identification or disclosure of a person or establishment
    violates the assurances of confidentiality given to the providers of the
    information.  Therefore, users will:

       1.  Use the data in this dataset for statistical reporting and
           analysis only.

       2.  Make no use of the identity of any person or establishment
           discovered inadvertently and advise the Director, NCHS, of any
           such discovery.

       3.  Not link this dataset with individually identifiable data from
           other NCHS or non-NCHS datasets.

    By using these data, you signify your agreement to comply with the 
    above-stated statutorily based requirements.

   CAUTION - Because the NAMCS CLAS is a sample survey, the application of 
   weights to the sample data is REQUIRED to produce national estimates
   of physicians, as well as to accurately assess the sampling error of
   statistics based on the survey data.  Please refer to the appropriate
   sections of the documentation file for information on how to apply the 
   weights and to obtain relative standard errors of national estimates.
