#### To get/construct GFED datasets:
- Get original data:
  - Download original GFED data from https://www.geo.vu.nl/~gwerf/GFED/GFED4/, place in folder "GFED4s"
- Construct GFED data with appropriate datasets multiplied by cell area:
  - Create folder "GFED4s_timesArea"
  - Copy all .hdf5 files from the original GFED data (from folder "GFED4s") into folder "GFED4s_timesArea"
  - Run "code/multiply_by_area_gfed4s.py"
